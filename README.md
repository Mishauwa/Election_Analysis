## Challenge Summary

Next to the analysis the underlying script is also for purchase. The script can be used with slight modifications for any elections and is easily written. 
It's possible to load different csv files and use the script. 

One example is to use the script for the next years election with new candidates. For that you only use the next years csv file. 
The file has to be formatted in the same way or the index of the candidates name and counties name in the for loop has to be adjusted. Also the path where the file is stored has to be adjusted to the new location and file name. A new text file should be created. For that the save path has to be changed. 

A second example is to use the election results from different counties. For that example you have to load also a new csv file. Format the csv in the right way and follow the steps above.
